## 1.4.1+1.19.2

* Bumped Lithium to [0.11.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium/version/m6sVgAi6), which [should resolve a crash when viewing Create's ponder animations](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/issues/455).

**Full changelog**: https://github.com/go-pound/go-pound-soul-sand/compare/v1.4.0+1.19.2..v1.4.1+1.19.2

## 1.4.0+1.19.2

* Re-added [Simple Emerald Tools](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-emerald-tools-fabric) 1.4.38. Upon further reflection, its recipes are pretty well-balanced. What wasn't balanced was how many ores we acquired in the Ultimate Survival World, which made crafting the powerful tools trivial.

* Added [MiniHUD](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minihud) 0.23.3. Press <kbd>H</kbd> to show and hide the HUD, and use <kbd>H</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to configure it.

**Full changelog**: https://github.com/go-pound/go-pound-soul-sand/compare/v1.2.0+1.19.2..v1.3.0+1.19.2

## 1.2.0+1.19.2

Now that we're done with the Ultimate Survival World, we're bringing back some of the content mods removed in Go Pound Sand 1.1.0.

* Removed Xaero's World Map and Minimap to increase immersion.
* Removed Simple Emerald Tools to balance the survival game and encourage us to build Create contraptions to harvest resources in greater quantities.

* Bumped Iris to [1.5.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris/version/1.5.0+1.19.2).
* Disabled Inventory Profiles' inventory scrolling in favor of Mouse Tweaks' positionally-aware scrolling feature. If you already have the mod pack installed, these changes may not be picked up automatically. To set them yourself:
  * Go to Mods > Inventory Profiles Next > Configure > Hotkeys, and clear the default "Scroll Wheel Up" and "Scroll Wheel Down" bindings for "Scroll Items from Player to Chest" and "Scroll Items from Chest to Player" by clicking on each hotkey button and pressing <kbd>esc</kbd>.
  * Go to Mods > Mouse Tweaks > Configure, and set "Scroll Direction" to "Inventory Position Aware".

* Bumped EMI to [0.5.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi/version/e8yMWd29).
* Replace JourneyMap default key bindings with Xaero's Minimap and World Map bindings.
* Resolve conflicts in the default key bindings:
  * Gameplay > [Tom's Simple Storage] Open Terminal is <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> to avoid conflicting with Multiplayer > Open Chat (<kbd>t</kbd>)
  * TrashSlot > Delete All Items of Type is <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>delete</kbd>
  * TrashSlot > Show/Hide TrashSlot is <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> to avoid conflicting with Multiplayer > Open Chat (<kbd>t</kbd>)
  * Traveler's Backpack > Swap Tool or Change Hose Mode is <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> to avoid conflicting with Xaero's Minimap > Enlarge Minimap (<kbd>z</kbd>)

* Enabled Traveler's Backpack Curios integration. Equip a backpack by hovering over your chest armor slot to make Curios' backpack slot appear.
* Tweak Inventory Profiles Next defaults to disable its sorting buttons when viewing a Traveler's Backpack inventory (the backpack has its own sorting buttons), allow picked-up items to use hotbar slots as in vanilla Minecraft, and allow unenchanted tools under 500 durability to break (so unenchanted wood, stone and iron picks will be used up as usual, but any enchanted or high-tier tools will be saved from accidental destruction). If you already have the mod pack installed, the latter two changes won't be picked up automatically. To set them yourself, go to Mods > Inventory Profiles Next > Configure, and set:
  * Locked Slots > Pick Items Directly into the Inventory to **false**
  * Auto Refill > Allow Some Non Enchanted Gear to Break to **true**
